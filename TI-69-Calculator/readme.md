# TI-69 Calculator

I thought it would be cool to learn advanced python stuff by writing a Mathematics library, so I'm writing a calculator!

Planned functionality includes defining functions, sequences (including fibbonaci), sums with sigma notation, determinants, etc.

Calculus, Statistics, Probability, and Linear Algebra will be covered, with a focus on basic Algebra to start out (obviously).

I'll put all of my physics equations in here too, and maybe try to write a solver that uses multiple functions to reduce the main function.
